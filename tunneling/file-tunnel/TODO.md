#TODO

* Refactor agrument parsing to use argparse module
* Clear files after forwarder shuts down (test that it will not break anything)
* Move top-level code to the main function where appropriate
* Use some gibberish named file names (must be hardcoded) if file names are not
supplied
* Create files if supplied file names do not exist
